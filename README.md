# SatRdays knowledge base

This repo contains our collective wisdom! If you think it's a bit small, we're out there working on gaining some wisdom to include here.

You can view the processed version of the knowledge base at [knowledgebase.satrdays.org](//knowledgebase.satrdays.org).

If you'd like to contribute to the knowledge base, everything from a typo fix, to a new resource, to a substantive piece of advice is welcome.

Contribute by [creating](//help.github.com/articles/creating-new-files/) or [amending](//help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) files in [content/](content/). If you're not comfortable making changes directly or want to discuss it first, raise an [Issue](//github.com/satrdays/knowledgebase/issues).
